# Code Assessment MSG

This project was created in the context of a code assessment for TNO.  The main
purpose of this project is not to provide a practical solution to a particular
need, but rather to demonstrate how I work as a software developer.  The
assignment did not specify whether I should work on the assessment strictly on
my own or that I could get external help. In a normal work situation I would
always be part of a team, with regular communication opportunities where I can
get clarifications about requirements and get feedback on solution ideas. In
the current assignment I am not yet part of the team, and as I expect to work
on confidential projects, external help is taboo anyway.

On a technical level the assignment is frighteningly simple. It's like applying
to be a cook in a prestigious restaurant and they ask you to fry an egg.
So in this project I am frying an egg and hope that my performance is conforming
to the desired standards of the restaurant.

Requirements: your system should have a Python installation that is newer than
version 3.4. The 'numpy' module is assumed to be installed.

To run 'the application', please clone this project on your device, change into
the project directory and run the `pads_simulation.py` python script.
