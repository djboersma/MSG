# Code Assessment MSG

This project was created in the context of a code assessment for TNO.  The main
purpose of this project is not to provide a practical solution to a particular
need, but rather to demonstrate how I work as a software developer.  The
assignment did not specify whether I should work on the assessment strictly on
my own or that I could get external help. In a normal work situation I would
always be part of a team, with regular communication opportunities where I can
get clarifications about requirements and get feedback on solution ideas. In
the current assignment I am not yet part of the team, and as I expect to work
on confidential projects, external help is taboo anyway.

On a technical level the assignment is frighteningly simple. It's like applying
to be a cook in a prestigious restaurant and they ask you to fry an egg.
So in this project I am frying an egg and hope that my performance is conforming
to the desired standards of the restaurant.
